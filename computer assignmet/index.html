<h1> WELCOME TO THE HOME PAGE</h1> 
<h4> This web pages are created for the computer assignments.</h4>


 home page is generally the primary web page a visitor navigating to a website from a search engine will see, and it may also serve as a landing page to attract visitors.Thus good home page design is usually a high priority for a website.For example, a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages. Wikipedia, for example, has a site directory at wikipedia.org that links to every language-specific home page, including en.wikipedia.org. <br>

 The term also refers to one or more pages always shown in a web browser when the application starts up. In this case, it is also known as the start page.

The word "home" comes from the use of the Home key on a keyboard to return to the start page at any time.(Home was a standard key long before the Web existed.) Many browsers also provide a button in the shape of a house for this.
